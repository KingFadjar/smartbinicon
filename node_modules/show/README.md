# Show
Command-line utility/middleware(TODO) for serving directories, including bower dependencies.

# Motivation
I do a lot of prototyping - directory with few html files, each one of them showing different app screen. This saves me from including css and js dependencies in every file.

I also wanted to stay lightweigh, grunt sucks.

# How it works
- serves current directory on http://127.0.0.1:3900/
- /*.html files are postprocessed, dependencies are appended to html
- http port fallbacks to random, if 3900 is already in use (TODO)

## Command-line tool
`show [--port 3900] [files...]`

    npm install -g show

    mkdir example
    cd example
    echo "<button class=btn>Bootstrap!</button>" > index.html

    bower install --save bootstrap
    show

## Redefine order manually using bower.json
TODO - dependency order in bower.json should override order inferred by "bower list" (if some sub-dependency is explicitly defined as first it should be loaded first)

## Additional command-line options
TODO

## Middle-ware
